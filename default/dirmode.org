* File Management
** Dired
Dired is a built-in file manager for Emacs that does some pretty amazing things! Here are some key bindings you should try out:

* Navigation

** Emacs / Evil
 
- n / j - next line
- p / k - previous line
- j / J - jump to file in buffer
- RET - select file or directory
- ^ - go to parent directory
- S-RET / g O - Open file in “other” window
- M-RET - Show file in other window without focusing (previewing files)
- g o (dired-view-file) - Open file but in a “preview” mode, close with q
- g / g r Refresh the buffer with revert-buffer after changing configuration (and after filesystem changes!)

*  Marking files
- m - Marks a file
- u - Unmarks a file
- U - Unmarks all files in buffer
- 't / t - Inverts marked files in buffer
% m - Mark files in buffer using regular expression
asterisco - Lots of other auto-marking functions
- k / K - “Kill” marked items (refresh buffer with g / g r to get them back)
- Many operations can be done on a single file if there are no active marks!
- Copying and Renaming files
- C - Copy marked files (or if no files are marked, the current file)
- Copying single and multiple files
- U - Unmark all files in buffer
- R - Rename marked files, renaming multiple is a move!
- % R - Rename based on regular expression: ^test , old-\&
Power command: C-x C-q (dired-toggle-read-only) - Makes all file names in the buffer editable directly to rename them! Press Z Z to confirm renaming or Z Q to abort.

* Deleting files
- D - Delete marked file
- d - Mark file for deletion
- x - Execute deletion for marks
- delete-by-moving-to-trash - Move to trash instead of deleting permanently
- Creating and extracting archives
- Z - Compress or uncompress a file or folder to (.tar.gz)
- c - Compress selection to a specific file dired-compress-files-alist - Bind compression commands to file extension

* Other common operations
- T - Touch (change timestamp)
- M - Change file mode
- O - Change file owner
- G - Change file group
- S - Create a symbolic link to this file
- L - Load an Emacs Lisp file into Emacs
